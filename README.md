Here is the front-end of the WTTJ test.

## Running

```bash
yarn

yarn start
```

## Roadmap

A list of things I would be improving in an actual project :

- Avoid rerendering the entire stack of components when server sends an event (for instance: adding specific listeners for each column)
- Typings starts to feel like a good idea
- Some functional tests would be great
- Per env config/deployment/ci management
- Style of course !
